## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility first CSS Framework

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind website](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - This helped me for the overall documentation as well as learning how to tackle this project using Tailwind CLI vs the Play CDN.
- [Tailwind cheatsheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) - This is an amazing one stop shop I referred back to often. Already have it bookmarked.
